# Abstract

This half-day workshop will explore the craft of digital musical instrument design. Craft practice is central to the working process of both acoustic and digital instrument builders. Unlike the higher-level NIME design frameworks and taxonomies that appear in the literature, craft knowledge is often personal, subjective, and occasionally difficult to describe in writing. This workshop will call attention to this important aspect of instrument design through a combination of discussion and a hands-on instrument design activity focused on sculpting the subtle behavioural details of an instrument. The workshop will also reflect on how craft knowledge can be better disseminated and shared in the NIME community.

# Introduction

Throughout its 16-year history, NIME has drawn on both the scientific method and a rich history of artistic experimentation. Building a New Interface for Musical Expression has never been a solely scientific exercise. As Perry Cook put it at NIME 2001: “Musical interface construction proceeds as more art than science, and possibly this is the only way that it can be done.”

Sergi Jorda coined the term digital lutherie to describe the creation of digital musical instruments (DMIs), writing in 2004:

> Digital lutherie is in many respects very similar to music creation. It involves a great deal of different know-how and many technical and technological issues. However, like in music, there are no inviolable laws. That is to say that digital lutherie should not be considered as a science, but as a sort of craftsmanship that sometimes may produce a work of art, no less than music.

In recent years, within the NIME paper track (known in some years’ conferences as the “scientific” program), there has been increasing emphasis on rigorous design processes and reflective, sometimes formal evaluation. This evolution is perhaps tied to increasing links between NIME and the broader domain of human-computer interaction (HCI). Jensenius and Lyons, reflecting on their NIME Reader anthology, write in 2016:

>While a healthy respect for adhoc, improvised approaches persists, we also see individuals and groups engage in more long-term and structured development work. This work is often focused on development as process, with an acknowledgment of both formal and informal evaluation of the interfaces as an important part of this process.

Many NIME frameworks have been proposed for design, taxonomy and evaluation. Partly due to the brevity of the NIME paper format, it is unclear the extent to which these frameworks are being actively used in the creation of new DMIs.

What is clear is that the published literature is not, and probably can never be, a comprehensive template for how to create a completely new DMI. This workshop intends to pick up where the literature leaves off, highlighting and querying the skills and decision-making processes in digital lutherie which go unremarked in scientific papers. In short, we seek to explore NIMEcraft: the craft of digital lutherie as distinct from its science and engineering.

# Considering craft

We deliberately avoid providing a comprehensive working definition of craft in this workshop, though it has been studied in contexts outside of NIME. Instead, we use the term as a stand-in for the personal, sometimes subtle, often subjective decisions which contribute to the identity of an instrument, but would not be captured in a high-level taxonomy of the instrument’s form or function. We also use craft to encompass the process and actions by which an instrument comes into being, as distinct from its final form, i.e. the how rather than the what.

## Craft in traditional instrument making

Craft is a culturally celebrated yet understudied aspect of instrument making. In acoustic instrumental traditions such as string instrument lutherie, a luthier’s craft (however it may be defined) is recognised as a critical aspect of their ability to produce high-quality instruments for professional players. A typical luthier spends years in training, acquiring skills in hand tool conditioning and usage, and learning to see and hear instrument quality in fine detail. It is rare for a luthier to start their own workshop upon leaving school; it is instead more likely that they will work in instrument repair and maintenance as part of a team for up to ten years before they are ready to consider becoming an independent maker. The process of learning and improvement will be ongoing throughout a career, just as the perfect instrument is a culturally-dependent ideal which is aspired to, but never realised.

Beyond the adherence to basic templates, acoustic principles and cultural traditions, it is craft which distinguishes playability among the most highly regarded (and thus played) instruments. Despite considerable study [3], many of these details still elude scientific quantification and systematic decomposition. String instruments in particular have tightly coupled, interdependent structure-behaviour relationships, which makes inference between making decisions and playability essentially impossible with current methods. Since craft can not be measured, it can not be communicated easily, and so this important part of instrument making does not receive the attention and prestige it deserves.

## Craft in Digital Instrument Design

Any DMI designer, faced with the task of creating a specific instrument, must make myriad practical decisions which are not the subject of scientific study and are not covered by published NIME frameworks. Some of these are engineering questions: the choice of microcontrollers or sensors; details of schematic design; choice of programming language; architecture of the code. Others concern physical aspects: what materials to use; form and size; how to sculpt the materials into precisely the right form. Still other decisions are aesthetic, including appearance, feel and sound design.

These practical decisions are typically not scientific: they do not contain testable hypotheses, nor can there be a generally agreed optimum solution. The decision-making process is often personal. Where these aspects appear in NIME papers, it is usually by way of giving context rather than providing transferable knowledge; a detailed discussion of how an instrument was built would be judged by many reviewers to be beyond the scope of what should appear in publication.

Some exceptions to this state of affairs can be found in published reflections from longtime practitioners, such as Perry Cook’s design principles. Still, Jensenius and Lyons suggest that a space for future expansion in the NIME community would be

>“Nurturing ideas: many NIME papers are fairly terse and have only room to present one (or a few) core ideas of a larger picture. It would be useful to create a space in which ideas can be expanded, generating new insights, suggesting new research directions, and supporting community-building.”

The purpose of this workshop is to call further attention to these factors which underlie the creation of every DMI, yet fall outside the scope of most published papers.
