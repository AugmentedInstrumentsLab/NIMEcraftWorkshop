  abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an instance of what we call `curated research', a concerted thinking, making and performance activity between two research teams with a dedicated interest in the creation of experimental musical instruments and the development of new performance practices. Our work builds theoretically upon critical work in philosophy, anthropology and aesthetics, and practically upon previous explorations of strategies for facilitating rapid, collaborative, publicly-oriented making in artistic settings. We explored an orientation to making which promoted the creation of a family of instruments and performance environments that were responses to the self-consciously provocative theme of `One Knob To Rule Them All'. A variety of design issues were explored including: mapping, physicality, the question of control in interface design, reductionist aesthetics and design strategies, and questions of gender and power in musical culture. We discuss not only the technologies which were made but also reflect on the value of such concerted, provocatively thematised, collective making activities for addressing foundational design issues. As such, our work is intended not just as a technical and practical contribution to NIME but also a reflective provocation into how we conduct research itself in a curated critical manner.},

  abstract = {The development of electricity, sound technology, electronics and computer science during the last 150 years has allowed the emergence of new kinds of musical devices. This paradigm shift from traditional to digital instruments has strong consequences for instrument identity and for the relationship between the musician and her/his instrument. Grounded in a situated cognitive linguistics perspective, this contribution first explores various definitions of the instrument (from general dictionaries and musicology literature) before analysing how members of the computer music community name and define their instrument/interface/device, etc. Analysing the different strategies of instrument naming used by designers and users of digital instruments and by authors in computer music literature allows us to study the on-going construction and negotiation of a new terminology. By highlighting the instability, the fuzziness but also the diversity of what an instrument is to these different speakers, these analyses contribute to a better understanding of the conditions of instrumentality in the digital era. More than just referring to a device, the notion of instrument rather qualifies the interaction with the users, thus allowing a new shift from the instrument as an ontological entity to an instrumental quality.},

  abstract = {The musical instruments of the 21st century and those of earlier times differ in many respects, be it their appearance, their technical functionality, their playing technique, or their sounds. And as they have changed, so too have our understandings of what a musical instrument is. The lacking precision of the current notion of the instrument and its incompatibility with contemporary instrumental forms are consequences of a technocultural process that raises fundamental questions about the identity of the musical instrument: When (and why) is something a musical instrument\textemdash{}and when (and why) is it not? In order to grasp the slight differences between the yet-to-be-defined instrumental and the assumed other, it seems reasonable to speak of instrumentality when denoting this particular specificity that instruments are supposed to feature. The present contribution seeks to prepare the ground for a reflective discussion on the concept of instrumentality and the underlying theoretical problem by considering not only the differences, but also the similarities between traditional and electronic musical instruments. Using a couple of different approaches to and views on the concept and defining a number of criteria of instrumentality, it eventually yields a picture of musical instruments that connects the contemporary ones with those known for centuries.},

For over 40 years, Rob has been hand crafting exceptional musical instruments from the modest facilities of his garden shed at the end of his Coventry garden. With a reputation as a formidable innovator rather than being satisfied with reproducing standardized instruments, this article seeks to understand Rob's approach to his trade, the nuances in his making activities, and his unending motivation and curiosity to keep pushing the boundaries of acoustic guitar design and construction.

  abstract = {This article outlines the foundations of an enquiry into the relationship between craft and authenticity. It provides a description of how authenticity is evolving as a philosophical concept, and what this might mean for claiming an authentic contemporary practice. It then illustrates an inconsistency in schematic analyses of craft and design thinking, which may be a barrier to the appraisal of craft as a form of `authentic' cognition. The author's personal evolution of visual conceptualizations of craft thinking is revealed through an enquiry into a decade of a digital craft practice reflexively differentiated from Human\textendash{}Computer Interaction, Interaction Design and Product Design. A novel framework is proposed for situating authenticity in craft in line with relational philosophy, comprising individual, social and ecological forms of practice, and the framework is applied to a recent multidisciplinary digital craft project. Further research into craft thinking using schematics is recommended.},

  abstract = {The aim of my research was to create a portrait following a sequential practice-based process. A mug-shot photograph of a female face was analysed and reinterpreted as an embroidered portrait. Hand-stitched embroidery and embellishment techniques define the facial features and surroundings of the subject matter. The final representation encapsulates my total experience while researching this woman's image in both a practical and a theoretical way. This encompasses the physical procedures of sketching, painting and embroidering her likeness, with a preoccupation and self-awareness necessary to understand the theories engaged with during these processes. I used an arts-based framework, looking at Michael Podro's writing `Depiction and the concept of subjectification' in interpreting the portrait subject. In my analysis of the mug shot I drew on Roland Barthes' theories of `essence' or `air' of a person and his concept of `punctum', the personal and unexplained emotional response caused by a photographic image. Similarly, Gilles Deleuze's concepts of `affection-image', the ability for a photograph, specifically the extreme close-up of the face or `traits of faceiticity', to move, touch, disturb, disgust... to profoundly affect the viewer with the `micro-expressions' and fine detail magnified in her frozen look. I also referred to Claire Valier's writings on the `punitive power' of the documentary photograph to punish, shame, shock, elicit guilt or incarcerate as a means of social commentary and an agent of justice (Valier 2004: 254). These philosophies informed the potency and persuasiveness of the photographic content. The picture acts as a visual record of an actual moment that facilitates belief in the accuracy of the event depicted. With this, my female subject represented in the mug shot was a criminal, a prostitute and there was incriminating physical evidence of drug addiction. By transforming the mug shot to a handcrafted embroidered portrait, I intended to remove the stigmatized version of the women. While doing so, I willingly addressed the issues of agency in the subject, viewer and image\textendash{}maker relationship. These concepts brought forth an intense analysis of my motives and intentions in making the portrait, which eventually lead to an understanding and development of a process that revealed my own translation of my subject's humanity.},

  abstract = {This article summarizes the findings of a long-term marketing research project whose objective was to determine existing consumption patterns in the needlecrafts industry in Turkey. The research was carried out by one of the authors while working at Coats Turkey (CT), the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of sewing and embroidery threads, as the Crafts Marketing Manager. A mini-case study of the company is therefore also included in the article. The main research questions addressed during the field study were `why and how do the thread consumers practice the needlecrafts?' On the basis of the findings obtained from the long-term analysis of consumer attitudes, a consumer segmentation pattern has been proposed. The pattern has been revealed through interviews and face-to-face surveys, with more than 1000 embroidery teachers working at vocational high schools and public education centres and their students attending classes between 2000 and 2009 in Turkey. The pattern depicts the segmentation of motives for doing needlecrafts and suggests a distribution based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs: as the socio-economical level of the consumer increases, the main motivation for doing needlecrafts stems from psychological rather than physical needs. Focusing more on the psychological needs of consumers, the company redesigned some of the experiences it offered to needlecraft consumers. Therefore, this article also elaborates on designing experiences for the needlecrafts industry and suggests that there may be opportunities for other crafts companies to implement such an approach, because as the competition gets intensive, product and service differentiation becomes more challenging and inadequate in terms of maintaining a sustainable business. Addressing psychological needs by means of designing experiences and focusing on experiential marketing seems to be one solution. Further research is needed to explore how other industries may benefit from focusing more on psychological needs by means of creating positive experiences.},
