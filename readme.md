Dear all,

As part of the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2017) conference, we would like to invite you to a hands-on instrument design workshop entitled “NIMEcraft: Exploring the Subtleties of Digital Lutherie”. This half-day workshop runs 15 May 2017, 9am-12pm.

The goal of this workshop is to explore and develop the craft of digital musical instrument creation as distinct from its science and engineering aspects. In particular, we seek to identify aspects of the DMI creation and refinement process that go beyond what is published in typical conference and journal papers. These aspects might include subjective or personal aspects of a designer’s craft, subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments, or the ways in which craft knowledge can be shared and disseminated.

Further context on these ideas can be found at:

The workshop will feature open discussion plus a hands-on instrument design activity, in which participants will adjust and improve the subtle details of an existing instrument design. Instruments will be provided, and no programming or circuit-building skills are required.

The workshop is open to conference attendees but attendance may be limited based on the amount of available hardware. No preparation is required to attend, but if you are planning to attend, we would encourage you to contact us at `j.d.k.armitage@qmul.ac.uk` so we ensure adequate materials are available.

We look forward to meeting you in Copenhagen.
